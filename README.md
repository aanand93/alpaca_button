# Alpaca Image Generator
> A simple react app that has a button and when clicked a different alpaca image will appear.

# Description
> This react app was built for my daughter who is 7 who is obsessed with alpacas. The plan was to create just a button with an onclick. I wanted to make it more technical and I was going to use an API however I haven't found any. My original plan was to download as many alpaca photos as possible but 1) that will take forever and 2) the file for this react project will eventually become huge for no reason. As of right now the app works with a small amount of alpacas to keep the project size small.

> Version 2 of the app will use puppeteer.js and will scrape urls off google images of alpacas and then randomize a selection from the list created of the urls similarly to the `alpacaClick()` function in version 1. This will allow there to be an almost infinite amount of alpacas and/or an updated daily version so new alpacas will appear as they are uplaoded to google images. Those features of how new the images will be, will be set up in the puppeteer functions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
